# Breast Cancer Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to address the crucial issue of early breast cancer detection by implementing a machine learning model. Built using Python and scikit-learn, the model boasts a high accuracy and specificity rate, making it a reliable tool for early diagnostics.


## Features

### High Accuracy
- Achieved a 92.9% accuracy rate and a 91.1% specificity score in test cases.

### Comprehensive Dataset
- Utilized a dataset consisting of over 550+ data points with multiple variables associated with breast cancer.

### Efficient and Interpretable Model
- Chose Logistic Regression for its computational efficiency and ease of interpretability.
- Exceeded predefined performance metrics with an AUC (Area Under the Curve) score of 92.6%.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn
- **Model**: Logistic Regression
